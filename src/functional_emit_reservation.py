MiniLM-free and import-acyclic: do not import footprint_alignment,

Occupancy authority for scenery-omit is HoMM3 visit ∪ non-visitable block only.
Native ObjectConfig GATE rings (e.g. chest/gold) must not reserve cells — those
rings invent walkable markers on cells HoMM3 often hard-blocks with mountains,
and reserving them falsely omits blocking scenery (holes). Interact cells stay
protected because they are already in the H3 visit set when keep-donor aligned.
Native OCC (nodes==1) outside that object's H3 visit∪block is likewise not
